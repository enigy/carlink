/**
 * The phone's offer to carry route A's video over its own network (`setProxyParameters`, sent once the box
 * offers video): a proxy on the phone's address that speaks TLS 1.3 with a pre-shared key, then HTTP CONNECT.
 * LIVI's receiver fetches every stream through it (protocol facts from its source), and a unit with no internet
 * of its own needs it.
 *
 * [address] is the proxy's URL as the phone sent it (`https://` and the phone's address); the box turns it into
 * a socket and refuses anything but the phone (OCBM `receiver::tunnel`). The key, its identity and the
 * authorization are secrets: [toString] leaves them out, and nothing logs them.
